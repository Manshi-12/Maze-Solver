# Maze-Solver
This Java project creates and solves random mazes using a depth-first search algorithm, with real-time visualization through a Swing GUI. Mazes are color-coded to show walls, paths, and visited cells. After solving one maze, the program pauses briefly before generating a new one in a continuous loop.
